# Data-Structures-Zoo
An educational repo for students looking to learn about data structures in Python
While this is based on a Java class, this rescoure will be using Python idioms.

#### Introduction
First of all, congratulations! If you're like me you probably just finished a tutorial or class on Python, but it left you wanting more. Your curiosity has led you to learn more about the fun things you can do in Python. This repo is meant to be a resource for those of you looking to dive into some interesting Computer Science topics.

The repository is laid out in a logical order and I suggest completing it in the order prescribed. You'll learn about the basics of OOP get into some of the math behind algorithm design and dive into the nitty gritty with Stacks, Linked-lists, and even Graphs!
